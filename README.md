## Reproducible-research-project-1

The goal of this assignment is to analyze a set of data and document it so that it is reproducible by others. After all, if others can't replicate it, it is not science. The components of this repo are as follows:

* A R markdown file of the data analysis. (analysis_doc.rmd)
* The data itself. (steps_data.csv)
* A html file corresponding to the rmd file. (analysis_doc.html)

### Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken


The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.
